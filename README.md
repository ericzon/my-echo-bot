Echo-bot
========

My aim with this project is just to give a simple base to help tackling the real problem. It's based in the example from Microsoft bot framework.


## Env variables

```
PORT=3000

# Bot: Fill these values from Azure Bot settings
BOT_ID=
BOT_PASSWORD=
BOT_SECRET=

# Fill these values from Azure Speech service settings
SPEECH_SVC_KEY=
SPEECH_REGION=
SPEECH_ENDPOINT=

```

## Public folder

It includes 2 versions of client, the basic one and another version using Azure Speech for STT (Speech to text).
